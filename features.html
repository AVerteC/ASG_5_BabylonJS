    <h2>Guide to Run Program:</h2>
    <u>How to Run:</u>
    <p>
        The program MUST be running on a live host in order for it to function. There are three 
        sources in which users can try out the AR program.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. GitHub Pages - Users must access the GitHub Pages link through an Android device 
        in order to get the AR Experience.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Apache Tomcat - Users are able to download the project folder in order to port 
        forward the website to their Android device. Steps to download and run the program are as follows:<br>        
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Download <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi">Apache Tomcat</a> by going to the link and 
            clicking on “32-bit/64-bit Windows Service Installer” on your PC<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Install Apache Tomcat and find it through Program Files (x86)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Go into Apache Software Foundation -> Tomcat 10.0 -> webapps -> ROOT<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Place the project folder into the ROOT folder<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Start the Apache Tomcat program<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Enable Developer Mode on the Android device and enable “USB Debugging”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Open up Google Chrome on your PC and paste the following into a browser: <b>chrome://inspect/#devices</b><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Verify if Port Forwarding is enabled and active<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Plug in Android device into PC and open up Google Chrome on the Android device<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <b>Note:</b> To view the perspective of the phone on your PC, go to step (g) for the link and under the “Remote 
            Target” title is where the Android device is. Click on “Inspect”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Paste in the following on Google Chrome in the Port Forwarding page textbox: 
            <b>http://localhost:8080/ASG_5_BabylonJS/index.html</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Live Website - 
    </p>
    <h2>Opening the Program:</h2>
    <p>
        Once the program is up and running on an Android device, the user will see a colored background with buttons 
        on each side providing different functionalities. To enter into AR Mode, tap on the bottom right icon 
        <img src="arIcon.jpg" width="40px" height="25px">.
    </p>
    <h2>Program Functionality:</h2>
    <u>Physics Engine:</u>
    <p>
        The program has a physics engine depending on the orientation the program entered AR Mode. Objects can move around 
        the world with collision given by the user. There are also two buttons that interact with the objects given force.<br>
        <b>Note:</b> If the user does not create a ground object into the world, the object will fall out of the world and 
        will disappear.
    </p>
    <u>Reticle</u>
    <p>
        After the world has been generated, a green donut-shaped reticle will appear in the middle of the user's device. It 
        acts as a cursor for the user to place down objects into the world, as well as interact with objects.
    </p>
    <u>Adding Objects</u>
    <p>
        There are 4 buttons the user can use to create objects. The objects the user can create are: Balls/Spheres, Cubes, 
        Cylinders, and Cones. When pressed, it drops down the selected object with a random color given onto the world.
    </p>
    <u>Adding Ground</u>
