    <!-- GUIDE TO RUN AND USE PROGRAM -->
    <h2>Guide to Run Program:</h2>
    <u>How to Run:</u>
    <p>
        The program MUST be running on a live host in order for it to function. There are two 
        sources in which users can try out the AR program.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. GitHub Pages - Users must access the 
        <a href="https://avertec.github.io/ASG_5_BabylonJS/">Github Pages</a> link through an Android device 
        in order to get the AR Experience.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Apache Tomcat - Users are able to download the project folder in order to port 
        forward the website to their Android device. Steps to download and run the program are as follows:<br>        
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Download <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi">Apache Tomcat</a> by going to the link and 
            clicking on “32-bit/64-bit Windows Service Installer” on your PC<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Install Apache Tomcat and find it through Program Files (x86)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Go into Apache Software Foundation -> Tomcat 10.0 -> webapps -> ROOT<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Place the project folder into the ROOT folder<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Start the Apache Tomcat program<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Enable Developer Mode on the Android device and enable “USB Debugging”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Open up Google Chrome on your PC and paste the following into a browser: <b>chrome://inspect/#devices</b><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Verify if Port Forwarding is enabled and active<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Plug in Android device into PC and open up Google Chrome on the Android device<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <b>Note:</b> To view the perspective of the phone on your PC, go to step (g) for the link and under the “Remote 
            Target” title is where the Android device is. Click on “Inspect”<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            - Paste in the following on Google Chrome in the Port Forwarding page textbox: 
            <b>http://localhost:8080/ASG_5_BabylonJS/index.html</b><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Opening the Program:</h2>
    <p>
        Once the program is up and running on an Android device, the user will see a colored background with buttons 
        on each side providing different functionalities. To enter into AR Mode, tap on the bottom right icon 
        <img src="arIcon.jpg" width="40px" height="25px">.
    </p>
    <h2>Program Functionality:</h2>
    <u>Physics Engine:</u>
    <p>
        The program has a physics engine depending on the orientation the program entered AR Mode. Objects can move around 
        the world with collision given by the user. There are also two buttons that interact with the objects given force.<br>
        <b>Note:</b> If the user does not create a ground object into the world, the object will fall out of the world and 
        will disappear.
    </p>
    <u>Reticle</u>
    <p>
        After the world has been generated, a green donut-shaped reticle will appear in the middle of the user's device. It 
        acts as a cursor for the user to place down objects into the world, as well as interact with objects.
    </p>
    <u>Adding Objects</u>
    <p>
        There are 4 buttons the user can use to create objects. The objects the user can create are: Balls/Spheres, Cubes, 
        Cylinders, and Cones. When pressed, it drops down the selected object where the cursor is with a random color given 
        onto the world.
    </p>
    <u>Adding Ground</u>
    <p>
        There is a button "Create Ground" that creates a floor for the user to place down objects on. Depending on where the 
        cursor is will create the ground. 
    </p>
    <u>Generating an Explosion/Tornado</u>
    <p>
        Two buttons "Create Explosion" and "Create Tornado" will generate physics in regards to the button created. Explosions 
        scatter the objects in respect to where the reticle is. Tornados will cause a swirl of objects in respect to the reticle.<br>
        <b>Note:</b> The tornado is very weak in terms of power when pressed. To generate a stronger tornado effect, user can tap 
        the button multiple times.
    </p>
    <u>Resetting the World</u>
    <p>
        When the "Reset Scene" button is pressed, it will remove all objects of the world to reset the scene to when the program was 
        first opened. 
    </p>


    <!-- ISSUES -->
    <h2>Issues:</h2>
    <p>
        - AR Mode on thr program will not work on PC/Desktop unless there is AR support or an AR emulator.<br>
        - When opening the program and going into Landscape Mode on the device before activating AR Mode, the 
        buttons will overlap each other and appear very large. The buttons will scale to the screen correctly 
        once the user enters AR Mode.<br>
        - Depending on when AR mode is activated in respect to Landscape Mode or Portrait Mode, the physics will 
        only be oriented to when the scene was first created. Example: If the user starts the program on portrait mode 
        and re-enters the program in landscape mode, the physics is bound to portrait mode and objects will fall sideways. 
        - Buttons will seem streteched or squished when the user enters and exits out of AR mode multiple times. 
        Refreshing the page will fix the issue.
